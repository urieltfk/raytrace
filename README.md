# file strucutre
- main.cpp - program entry point.
- include - folder for header files.
- test - TBD, tests for different models etc.

# requirements
- A cpp compiler compatible with C++20

# compiling and running:
To create a debugable .out file, just write make end press enter.
the other options are as follows:

- image - makes and creates an image according to the parameters supplied in main.cpp.
- clean clears .out files, any leftovers from compilation and generated images.
- opt - creates an O3 optimized build as opt.out.


# Technologies used:
- CPP20
- Makefile
